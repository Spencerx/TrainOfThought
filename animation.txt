The simplest way to create version 0 of a video explainer for me would probably be:
Videotape me drawing the thing with a sharpie while talking

The simplest way to create version 0.1 of a video explainer for me would probably be:
-quick&dirty draw all things (in Inkscape or something)
-everything with the same timing goes in the same SVG group
-order the groups so the 1st to fade in is the 1st <g>
-add empty <g>'s for fading out: where id's mention other id's to fade out e.g. "remove..."
-add a script that for every time you hit the space bar jumps to the next <g> and does the fade in/out
-use your foot to cue, time touches on the screen accordingly, while talking, capture video from above the screen

touch circle A
text field with microphone A

recognizing text A

right finger B

touch circle B
