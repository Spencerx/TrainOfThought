# Train of thought (formerly sketch-a-LOD)

### A linked mindmapping tool (multi-touch + speech recognition + Linked(Open)Data + keeping-your-flow-UI = quick semantic graph design)


SETTINGS (write-out of 1_information-space-settings.jpg) :

everything to be identified with URL(s):
1. THIS 'thoughtspace' to work/cooperate in
2. user, followed by a LOGIN-BUTTON
3. ontologies available in this thoughtspace
4. LINKspaces available in this thoughtspace (What I call LINKspaces are usually called triplestores)
// is there a clear divide between ontologies(3) and LINKspaces(4)? Can ontologies be created in thoughtspaces? Can I refer to a triple somewhere else, as not copying is the point of this all?

For making ontologies (3) easier to enter one could use a table with suggestions like:

|checkbox|name                    |URL        |

|--------|------------------------|-----------|

|      V |DC(Dublin Core)         |https://...|

|      V |FOAF(Friend Of A Friend)|https://...|

|      V | enter name             | enter URL |

For making LINKspaces (4) easier to enter one could use a table with suggestions like:
